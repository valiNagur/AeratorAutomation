Aerator Automation & Monitoring System

The Aerator Automation & Monitoring System is a cutting-edge solution designed to automate and monitor aeration processes in the aquaculture industry. By integrating Dissolved Oxygen (DO) values, this system significantly reduces manual labor and boosts production output. It enhances efficiency and accuracy in regulating aeration processes and provides 
real-time data visualization for resourceful management and optimized system performance.

Features
:
Automated Aeration Control: Automatically adjusts aeration based on real-time DO values.
Real-Time Monitoring: Provides continuous monitoring of DO levels and system status.
Data Visualization: Offers real-time visualization of data for better decision-making.
Improved Efficiency: Reduces manual intervention and optimizes aeration processes.
Resource Management: Helps in managing resources efficiently, leading to cost savings and improved productivity.
